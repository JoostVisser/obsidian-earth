### Other notes





#### Open points meeting Charlotte
1. What to do with examples?
2. Explain the point of GeoJSON.
3. Should we make a rule: only use new Geometry for the new API?
    1. What about Polygon and LineString?
4. Where should I put the parsing?
    1. Think it makes sense to put it in the API layer, but some code like ParamsGenerator.Params might also use it? 
5. Where to put validation?
    1. Validating the GeoJSON string actually already happens inside the deserialization.
        1. (Closed loop, at least 4 points)
    2. Null check validation should be inside the API, which can be done using [JsonRequired].
    3. Business logic checks (min size, max size) should perhaps be inside the AgxRouteLib library.
    4. Don't require [JsonRequired] on response.
