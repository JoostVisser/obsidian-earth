### Meeting Agenda

Blob storage:
- Different assumptions
- How do you know that Cold has worse times than Hot?


### Orchard info
There are two steps for the orchards:
1. Orchard initialization: this happens in `fieldStorage.verify.Verify()`
2. Orchard blockiness: this happens in  `GenerateMainlines` (using `GenerateMainlandLinesFromOrchardLines`)

### Other notes

Perhaps use log analytics:
- Log debug, info, warning, can create alerts from them.

Azure Data Explorer, ADX, for dashboards:
- DataBricks is een translation tool
