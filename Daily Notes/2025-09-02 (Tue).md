### Other notes

Charlotte comments list:
- CHANGELOG.md
    - Docs: `Add name of user setting` Slight improvement, not super important.
    - Docs: `remove less mainland line length` less impact, is more correcdt
- File names:
    - Eh, honestly, they're a little too nitpicky for me, but you're right in that the filenames can be a little better. I specifically didn't request the `e` -> `E` change because that would require me to explain how that works in git. (I think it's `git move ...` that requires it)
- OrchardMainlandLines.md:
    - In general, I'm noticing that you're much more precise with documentation than I am. Lots of comments can be explained this way. I'm looking more into: do I roughly understand it if I grab the docs and code next to each other. I think you're really looking at: is everything written correct, sufficient and explained.
- MainlandMerger.cs:
    - `Function is too long and too many nested if statementsFunction is too long and too many nested if statements` Agreed. I actually also made a similar comment but also a suggestion for a different algorithm on how to resolve it. 
    - `ParamsGenerator.Params parameters` Kinda agree, but
