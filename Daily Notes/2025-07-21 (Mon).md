### Other notes
Need to create a new resource-group: `dev-motionplan-resgrp-northeu`, containing:
- Storage account: `devmotionplanstorage`
- FunctionApp: `dev-motionplan-func-northeu`
    - Linked to the storage account.
    - Linked to the Event Grid.
- Application Insight: `dev-motionplan-func-northeu`
    - Linked to the FunctionApp, or perhaps just activate it with the biceppiness of the FunctionApp.
- Event grid topic: `dev-motionplan-topic-northeu`

Remove the following from our resource groups:
1. `dev-motionplan-webapp-northeu`
2. `dev-motionplan-asp-northeu`
3. `dev-motionplan-vpn-northeu` 
4. `dev-motionplan-apim-northeu`
5. App service plan itself: `ASP-devmotionplanresgrpnortheu-ae24`
6. Application Insights Smart Detection, whatever that is.
