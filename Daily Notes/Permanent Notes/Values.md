Your values are the things that you believe are important in the way you live and work. They (should) determine your priorities, and, deep down, they're probably the measures you use to tell if your life is turning out the way you want it to.

When the things that you do and the way you behave match your values, life is usually good â€“ you're satisfied and content. But when these don't align with your personal values, that's when things feel... wrong. This can be a real source of unhappiness.

Values are usually fairly stable, yet they don't have strict limits or boundaries. Also, as you move through life, your values may change. As your definition of success changes, so do your personal values. This is why keeping in touch with your values is a lifelong exercise.

Defining your values:
1. Identify the times when you were happiest
2. Identify the times when you were most proud
3. Identify the times when you were most fulfilled and satisfied
4. Determine your top values, based on your experiences of happiness, pride, and fulfilment
5. Prioritise your top values
6. Reaffirm your values


You can use these values to craft your own personal mission statement, e.g. using [this template](https://www.jmu.edu/osarp/programs/mentor/mentors/missionstatement-resources/mission-creation-senge-covey.pdf).
