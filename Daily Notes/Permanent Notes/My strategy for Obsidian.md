The strategy I use for PKM uses [[Zettelkasten]] with the hybrid approach of [[PARA]].

My intention for using Obsidian is to:
1. Have a list of open projects so I quickly can work on stuff I'd like with relevant information.
2. Store information and ideas in a more permanent location
3. Let them be easily findable


### PKM strategy
My initial strategy will be as follows.
1. The note-taking style will follow Zettelkasten:
    1. Title as index + small summary at the start
    2. Main body (easy use for summary preview)
    3. Ending with references
2. Note types:
    1. Fleeting notes -- Acts as a inbox and still needs to be reviewed and related
    2. Permanent notes -- Finished notes, reviewed from fleeting notes
    3. Daily notes -- For task lists and notes I take each day
3. Note organisation will be done in accordance to [[PARA]], but with MOCs.
    1. **Projects** contain MOCs with active projects
    2. **Area** contains MOCs with long-term area of responsibilities
        - Created in a just-in-time basis
    3. **Resources** contains MOCs with relevant topics clustered
        - Created in a just-in-time basis
    4. **Archives** contain archived topics of the first three.
4. The MOCs themselves will follow strategy 1 of [[MOC]], i.e. just listing the backlinks.



#### Projects
Projects need to have an **intention**.


### Pillars behind the strategy
Some of the pillars of my PKM:
1. Quick and easy usage
2. Bottom-up approach for note organisation
3. Top-down approach for projects


### Final note
1. I'll probably *not use any tags* as long as I don't need them.
2. The goal is to provide an organic organisation: the more I write about something, the more articles there will be and thus the need for a meta-note might be nice.
