**MOC**, also known as a **Maps of Content,** which are basically index notes that map to other notes.

An optimisation you could make is that you could actually order the MOCs with headers. 

There are in general two methods to create MOCs:
- Bottom-up: When you feel the trickle of overwhelm, create a new MOC.
- Top-down: create some projects and all articles related to said projects

### How to implement in Obsidian
Method 1: [Use dataview and backlinks](https://obsidian.rocks/quick-tip-quickly-organize-notes-in-obsidian/)
- In a relevant note, add a link to the MOC. (Then it'll automatically list the links.)
- Optimisation: add headers to the MOCs to organise them a bit (Inbox, etc)

Method 2: Link them manually
- Obsidian automatically updates whenever a pages changes

Method 3: Use dataview and tags
- Advantage over 1: cleaner style
- Disadvantage over 1: can't use tags the normal way
- Disadvantage over 1:
