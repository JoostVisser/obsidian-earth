Para is a method for organising your Obsidian notes.

It consists of four top-level categories:
1. P: Projects — Short-term efforts you're working on now.
2. A: Area — Long-term responsibilities you want to manage over time
3. R: Resources — Topics of interest that may be useful in the future.
4. A: Archives — Inactive items from the other three categories

### Advantages of PARA
Allows to list the current active projects.
- Actionable, with intention so you know what your current workload and priorities are
- Short-term, can be crossed off


### Implementing PARA in Obsidian
Have a look at https://tylersuzukinelson.com/2021/11/16/different-para-implementations-in-obsidian/, that suggests three approaches:
1. **Full-folder:** Each PARA + each project is their own folder
2. **Full-MOC:** Each PARA + each project is a [[MOC]]
3. **Hybrid:** Each PARA is a folder, each project is a [[MOC]]
