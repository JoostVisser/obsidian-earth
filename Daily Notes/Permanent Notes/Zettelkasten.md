**Zettelkasten** is a way of organising notes. It consists of three elements:
1. Unique identification at the start
2. Main body of content
3. Ending with related references

Similar to a Wikipedia article, this allows you to go to related elements to the topic.

Instead of a top-down approach of organisation, it's a bottom-up approach that 
dynamically creates groups and links from the content point of view.

## Elements of Zettelkasten
### Note types
They define a number of [note types](https://beingpax.medium.com/fleeting-notes-vs-literature-notes-vs-permanent-notes-d44364fe5fe7):
1. **Fleeting notes:** Ideas or reminders that can pop in any time, everyday thoughts.
2. **Literature notes:** Notes from literature you consume; which can be books, websites or videos. Try to keep them short.
3. **Permanent Notes:** 
    1. Should be atomic in nature (only contain one idea)
    2. Link to other notes and contain references
    3. Written in own words

In general, fleeting notes and literature notes become permanent notes which will lay permanent in folders. They're basically reviewed and linked notes.


### Elements of Zettelkasten
Some important elements of Zettelkasten are:
1. **Simplicity:** Whenever you think of something, just write it down.
2. **Serendipity:** You can learn by communication, which is surprising (something that wasn't in your current monkey brain)


### Layers of Zettelkasten
See the [Zettelkasten blogpost](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/three-layers-structure-zettelkasten/) for more info.
1. Bottom layer -- Content, i.e. the pages
2. Middle layer -- Structure notes: containing a set notes
3. Top layer -- Main Structure Notes (with double hash-tag), containing a set of structure notes

## Implementing Zettelkasten in Obsidian
The two connections can be implemented as follows:
- **Direct connection:** directly linking the URL
- **Indirect connection:** Use something like tags to get similar articles.
