New zealand residency.
Two tactics:
1. Apply for a Skilled Migrant Category Resident Visa (https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/visas/visa/skilled-migrant-category-resident-visa)
  - Requires at least 180 points, doable through either
    - (i) working outside of Auckland [12 months] or +20
    - (ii) Offer a pay above ~6000 euros a month [3 months] +20
    - (iii) Work for a New Zealandish company for 1 year. (+10 and +10 for working experience)
    - (iv) Have 3 more years of working experience (+20)
    - (v) Study more (PhD, Japanese master, Auckland university)
2. Tier 1 Straight to Residence
  - Requires at least $61.69 of moneyz
3. Tier 2 Work to Residence
  - Work for 2 year in NZ
  - Requries at least $61.69?


For the case where I already want to work in NZ, there's something called the AEWV I need to apply for and only accredited companies can provide this.
  
The most likely way is to go for option 1.ii, option 1.iii or option 2, but it's pretty difficult.
