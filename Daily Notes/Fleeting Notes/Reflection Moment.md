What should I do for the reflection moment?

Here are some questions I can ask:
1. Which productivity technique is currently active?
    1. How are they going?
    2. Can they be revised or improved?
    3. Can they be removed? Less techniques == better focus.
2. How did the last few weeks go? Be honest with yourself.
3. How is the reflection moment going?

We could maybe even write a small report.
