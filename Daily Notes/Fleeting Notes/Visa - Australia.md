- Need at least 65 points, which requires (i) very proficient English; my previous Toefl test wasn't good enough
- Processing times (25% - 90%): 82 days - 90 months
- Requires a nomination via SkillSelect, which requires the results to be known in advanced. 
- Costs: €2600
- Requires a nomination from an area. Can be e.g. living in Melbourne for two year.



Pretty sure Option 482 or option 190 are my two best choices.
- Option 1 requires networking and proactive contact
    - Honestly, a good skill for me to practice :). Fail faster!
    - Gotta make use of recruiters and contact. 
- Option 2 requires a high-level English skill and has more certainty.
    - Probably doable as well.
