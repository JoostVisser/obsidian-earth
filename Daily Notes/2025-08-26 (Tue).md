### Other notes

Ways to create an integration test for APP-1061:
- Set collisioncheckcompensationfactor to 0, then some orchard diagnostic tests might fail; check if this is due to Orchard bumps.
- Create a new field, change the orchard location a little, see if it bumps.

For logging of calls, what to do?



Main advantage of LogAnalytics:

To be decided:
- Falende calls opslaan ipv alle calls.
- run_info.json in een data-lake te gooien.

- Exceptions fatsoenlijke loggen.
--> Alert op gooien.
