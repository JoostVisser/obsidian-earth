### Other notes

Oof, I'm tired. Maybe due to the coffee?

I love the philosophical discussion I'm having with Claude, by the way. Instead of a *pragmatic existensialist*, I'm now considered a *post-existentialism naturalist*, because I believe in the laws of nature, basically, with a hint of ; basically, making things relative to lived experience.

I'm a fan of *epistemic humliity*: there are limits of what we can know while living within those limits.

Close people:
- Daniel Denett's "compatibilism" - the free will worth wanting is something we actually have.
- Thomas Nagel's "view from nowhere" - we can conceputally understand we might be determined, but we can't help but experience agency.
