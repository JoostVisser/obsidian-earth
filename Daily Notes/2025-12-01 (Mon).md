### Other notes



Logging strategy, what would we like to log?

We have four categories:
- Error: on Error on the highest level, we log these.
- Warning
- Information
- Debug

Ideas for logging:
- When calling all routing functions, we could create a Debug log or Information log about how much time any specific step took:
    - GenerateHeadland took "x"ms
    - GenerateMainland took "x"ms
- This could be either Information or Debug.



Warning ideas:
- Any warning codes that we will return should also be logged as `Warning`.
  Ideally, we log them directly whenever the warning happens in the AgxRouteLib.


Information ideas:
- Request's result summary:
  ```
    _logger.LogInformation(
        "Route calculated: {RequestId} | Duration: {ElapsedMs}ms | Field: {FieldId}",
        requestId, elapsed, waypointCount, fieldId);
    }
     ```
    



Debug ideas:
- Decision points in logic: `_logger.LogDebug("Selected turn type {TurnType} for angle {Angle}° at waypoint {Index}", turnType, angle, index);`
- Logging all "status" or progress calls: `_logger.LogDebug("Route calculation progress: {Phase} ({PercentComplete}%)", phase, percent);`
    - We also keep track of them in CosmosDB when using the Async worker, but it might be worth to have this available in the logs.
- 


The goal is to have a nice log that reads as a story about what happens when we perform a routing request.





Basically, when we have a routing:
- "Start routing request ..."
- 

We use the DEBUG flag specifically for ...





// Progress for long operations (your "progress bar" data)
