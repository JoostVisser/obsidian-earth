### Other notes



Logging strategy, what would we like to log?

### Logging strategy

We have four categories:
- Error: on Error on the highest level, we log these.
- Warning
- Information
- Debug

Ideas for logging:
- Always add a request ID so we can easily trace it in ApplicationInsights.
- We create a "summary" log at the end, with:
    - Information: Time taken, + whether successful.
    - Warning: All warning codes that happened with messages
    - Errors: Error codes + messages, with the exception as well (which contains the original lines where it happened)
- Optional, additional logs:
    - Timing logs for different states, Information:
        - Generate Headland took 700ms
        - Generate mainland took 200ms
    - Debug: decision points in logging.
        - "Selecting turn type X for Y."
    - Debug: The current different "progress state" that we keep track of with percentage.
    - Debug logs for the call with parameters (we already know when it gets called and started, and already have replay files so it's not really necessary)
