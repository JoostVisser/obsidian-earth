### Review incorporation Bart

Blob storage costs:
- What do you mean with an accumalative figure at your blob storage feedback?
- I'd actually say the following makes sense:
    - Remove route binary after a month
    - Keep a `run_info.json` + `input_call.json` + `params_result.json` for every run
    - Do you have a suggestion on how we can store the runs? We could store it time-based.

Performance:
- Always-ready instance of durable being slower: within standard deviation.

Increased cold-start time for complex tasks:
- JIT compilation time

Conclusion:
- What do you mean with seems off: due to the increased JIT compilation time for complex tasks?
- Autoscaling, do you mean concurrency per instance?
