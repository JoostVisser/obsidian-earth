### Other notes

Need to create a new resource-group: `dev-motionplan-resgrp-northeu`, containing:
- Storage account: `devmotionplanstorage`
- FunctionApp: `dev-motionplan-func-northeu`
    - Linked to the storage account.
    - Linked to the Event Grid.
- Application Insight: `dev-motionplan-func-northeu`
    - Linked to the FunctionApp, or perhaps just activate it with the biceppiness of the FunctionApp.
- Event grid topic: `dev-motionplan-topic-northeu`
- Database: `dev-motionplan-cosmosdb-northeu`

Remove the following from our resource groups:
1. `dev-motionplan-webapp-northeu`
2. `dev-motionplan-asp-northeu`
3. `dev-motionplan-vpn-northeu` 
4. `dev-motionplan-apim-northeu`
5. App service plan itself: `ASP-devmotionplanresgrpnortheu-ae24`
6. Application Insights Smart Detection, whatever that is.


#### FunctionApp settings
For the functionApp, the following settings are inmportant:
- .NET 8 Isolated
- Link to EventGrid using key-value pairs:
    - EventGridKeySetting: ...
    - EventGridUriSetting: ...
- Flex Consumption
- 4096 MB
- Linux


#### Next steps:
1. Figure out a way to call our API, so we can see the errors. :)
2. 
3. EventGrid

- Bicep the Proto-API:

- We need to create the new resource group: `dev-motionplan-resgrp-northeu` containing:

- Storage account: `devmotionplanstorage`

- New `dev-motionplan-northeu` FunctionApp with:

- .NET 8 Isolated
- `devmotionplanstorage`
- EventGrid connections:

- EventGridKeySetting
