#### API Testing
When do I need to extract logic to a service?
- I reuse certain logic multiple times between different endpoints.





## API Testing strategy
The main idea behind our strategy is to keep it as simple as possible.

Here are the rules for testing:
1. Every endpoint will be tested.
2. We do not mock our own library
3. We make fakes for our data storage every single following the repository pattern.
4. We skip End-to-end tests for now and focus on unit and integration tests.
5. We mock the logger.

We could consider mocking our actual routing part if it takes a long time and we want to speed up the test, but we'll keep this for later (we don't need this now, so we're not doing it, and most of the routing logic will be tested in-library anyway).












Exception: Mock only if:

The dependency is genuinely slow (>1 second per test)
You have separate comprehensive tests for that dependency
You're testing error handling/edge cases that are hard to trigger with real implementation




So, to summarize this conversation:
- Don't mock or fake AgxRouteLib, because that's the core logic that we want to test and own. (Technically, we can mock this library to test just this simple API wrapper layer, but using the KISS principle it's not worth it.)
- Use Fakes for external dependencies, specifically:
  - CosmosDB/Blob storage/Event grid
- Use services only when it gets used multiple times.
- It's fine if services don't depend on IService if I don't mock it. Services also don't have to end on service.


Few questions:
What if a service depends on another service. We still don't want to mock it to isolate the tests more? We could also mock our own core logic just to test the thin layer? Is that not worth it?


Then, in the end, I will have:
- Services tests
- Endpoint tests
