While the main event was the Moonlight Mangrove Madness on Saturday evening, that was definitely not the only thing that happened!

=== Thursday ===

Let's turn back time a bit to Thursday evening, where I arrived at the British Embassy. They organize a drink every month, just for fun sake.

I met some amazing people, including:

A Dutch couple, with a so-called dog mediator.
- Her husband and she came together to Gambia as they worked remote before it was cool by setting up a drop-shipping company from Germany to the Netherlands. The husband transitioned into becoming a local car repair mechanic, while the lady chased her passion: doggies.
- She now consults with tips about dog behaviour (explaining certain behaviour from a race perspective, trying to think of solutions) as well as checks on dogs when other expats go on holiday (and somehow the local folk taking care of the dog always manage to fail to do so).

A British guy who used to manage the cafeteria for high-ranked people, like Arabian princes or British royalty, or, worst of all, high-level British snobs paying for VIP boxes at Tottenham Hotspurs. Now he's giving advice to local restaurants.

I even might've helped Thijssie get another customer, as I managed to connect him to a local who was interested in solar panels (and was kinda disappointed at another company, whose solar panels broke after a year).

The British embassy itself was a lot fancier than the German embassy, with a fußball table, a bar and even a swimming pool (pool's closed, though). They rented some people with a pizza oven, so we could buy some pizza there. The pizza was nice, if a little underbaked (Gambian Specialty™, saves a little money).

=== Friday ===

At around 3PM, I got a call from Thijs: "Ehh, so, my car broke down and I'm kinda stuck here. Can you bring the big car and pick me up?" Oh boy.

So, after finishing up a little work, I picked up the keys, struggled opening the gates and grabbed the big car to pick up Thijs. Wee, driving in Gambia! It's pretty fun. :)

I picked up Thijs, and after dropping off the keys to his team (that would tow the car back to base), we would go on route to pick up a couchsurfer for the weekend: Saskia! 

She's a lovely lady who's on a mission to go from south Senegal to her home in Belgium via land, as to end her year+ long sabbatical after her PhD — to be honest, who doesn't need that after a PhD? What's interesting is that her parents hopped around during her youth, so she lived in a bunch of interesting countries, including a year in North Korea when she was six (it sucked) and 5'ish years in Cambodia.

Saskia stuck to us in the weekend and we had a lot of fun times, from bantering about travels to her passion of Lindy Hop, a kinda hyperactive swing dance from the 30's.

Well, Saskia, if you do happen to read this, hope you're doing great. :)

=== Saturday === 

We woke up early and picked up more ladies — Lonneke and Isabel, more friends of Thijs coming over. They also joined us over the weekend, but they stayed in a resort, so they could swap between local Gambian madness and resort-life (but without Thijssie). Great people...

...and struggled through some Cross-Fit. At least Isabel helped me out here, as she was used to it. Luckily, the session didn't cause me to be unable to walk for three days; instead, we were even able to do the whole Moonlight kayaking mentioned earlier.

=== Sunday ===

Pancake Sundary morning, thanks Thijssie. ♥
We went to DouDou's restaurant near the Senegal border, which is a very fancy fish restaurant. We had a performance, and the lobster + fish combination was delicious (for only nine euros). 

The toilet nearby was fun, because you had to flush yourself using a good ol' fancy bucket.
And oh boy, was I stuck in the toilet. I contracted something called heartily by the locals as the "Banjul Belly". To quote an article online: "Don't let 'Banjul Belly', otherwise known as travellers' diarrhoea (TD), ruin your holiday in The Gambia. Mild, moderate or severe diarrhoea affects about 40% of European travellers who spend a fortnight or more in The Gambia."

From my side, it was basically a severe stomache ache and often being stuck in the toilet. At least we had some pills available so I could escape the white jail, but even then, I often had to lie down due to the pain. Oh well, it was bound to happen eventually anyway, I'm very surprised it took three weeks.
