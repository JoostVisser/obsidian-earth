While the main event was the Moonlight Mangrove Madness on Saturday evening, that was definitely not the only thing that happened!

=== Thursday ===

Let's scoot back a bit to Thursday evening, where I arrived at the British Embassy. They organize a drink every month, just for fun sake.

I met some amazing people, including:

A Dutch couple, with a so-called dog mediator.
- Her husband and she came together to Gambia as they worked remote before it was cool by setting up a drop-shipping company from Germany to the Netherlands. The husband transitioned into becoming a local car repair mechanic, while the lady chased her passion: doggies.
- She now consults with tips about dog behaviour (explaining certain behaviour from a race perspective, trying to think of solutions) as well as checks on dogs when other expats go on holiday (and somehow the local folk taking care of the dog always manage to fail to do so).

A British guy who used to manage the cafeteria for high-ranked people, like Arabian princes or British royalty, or, worst of all, high-level British snobs paying for VIP boxes at Tottenham Hotspurs. Now he's giving advice to local restaurants.

I even might've helped Thijssie get another customer, as I managed to connect him to a local who was interested in solar panels (and was kinda disappointed at another company, whose solar panels broke after a year).

The British embassy itself was a lot fancier than the German embassy, with a fußball table, a bar and even a swimming pool (pool's closed, though). They rented some people with a pizza oven, so we could buy some pizza there. The pizza was nice, if a little underbaked (Gambian Specialty™, saves a little money).

=== Friday ===

At around 3PM, I got a call from Thijs: "Ehh, so, my car broke down and I'm kinda stuck here. Can you bring the big car and pick me up?"
