### Travel entry

Welcome to Caminito Del Rey!

Caminito Del Rey is an amazing path in-between gorges and through valleys. I kinda wanted to do this one last week, but due to the weather (and sleep problems), I postponed it for a week; it did mean I had to travel a total of 5 hours by car, though. D:

Was it worth it? Hell yeah!

Back in the day, they created this path for the workers on the hydroelectric power-plant. A channel was created to move the water on a high level from the beginning of the gorge to the end of the gorge, after which it'd go through a turbine to create electricity for the important harbour city MÃ¡laga. 

The gorges were amazing; it's reaally difficult to show the scale of the gorges, but they're massive. The river (which created the gorge) echoes loudly as it storms through the gorge. And then, after half an hour of walking between the confined walls of the gorge, a massive valley reveals itself; a small paradise in between two hellish exits.

There was also the occasional bridge or train track, making for some fancy pictures.

Finally, I ended up the day at the restaurant El Mirador (the view), because that location also happens to have a lake with lots of small green hills. The food was great (8/10) and the views were even better.
