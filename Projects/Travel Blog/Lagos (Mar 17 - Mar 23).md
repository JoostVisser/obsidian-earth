Coming from the very small, almost claustrophobic streets of CÃ¡diz to the white and wide streets of Lagos: what a breath of fresh air!

Welcome to Portugal, Joost. :D

Lagos is a small city (population of 40 000) that's fully focussed on tourism. Everywhere you go around,  you find the shops and restaurants with English signs; even the harbour of Lagos basically consists of 40 stands lined with the main three things you can do here:
1. Boat trips to caves
2. Dolphin watching boat trip
3. Kayak trip to caves

There's also a small surfing scene here, where mainly tourists grab a board and surf.

So of course, me being the adventurous person, I did... none of them! :D  The weather was kinda too unpredictable to do any of those.

Instead, the hostel I stayed had really nice vibes, so most of the time I either hung out with them or went walking south of Lagos to the lighthouse. I went to bars quite often, where I kinda fell in love with the karaoke place. <3 (I'm, too sexy for my shirt, too sexy for my shirt sooo sexy it huuurts!)

While chatting with some fellows from the hostel, I noticed that I did not really get any energy out of my work at the moment. It's a very nice insight which I might use later on as well. The only day where working went alright was when I went to a co-working space, since I could fully concentrate on work. 

After the drinks at the co-working space, I grabbed a green wine with two ladies at a restaurant nearby. It was great to speak with them, because they live a different life from the hostel travelers. They lived here for a longer period of time, and one of them owns an Airbnb here, another one is a freelancing Chief Happiness Officer at a German company and doing some design work here and there. They seem to know all the owners of all the surf-shops, hostels and coffee shops, so it was super interesting hanging out with them!

Finally, the coast line looks amazing. The mix of caves, rough cliffs and sandy beaches in between is apparently something I really love. One night .

On my final day, I went to a small day-trip to the Seven Hanging Valleys Trail, which basically contains even more gorgeous valleys and cliffs.

Some other highlights:
- Coffee was nice everywhere.
- Many surf shops. :)
- Cork products everywhere. Apparently Alentejo (region above the current region) is the main cork producer around the world, so this is the standard "touristy shop" product. Pretty cool, actually. I accidentally stole a cork bracelet from one of those shops, after which I secretly "unstole" it by putting it back while nobody was noticing, haha.
- Lagos is the final destination of the so-called Fisherman's trail, which is a twelve-day trail following the south-west coast of Portugal. We'll see more of this in the future. ðŸ‘€

Despite it being touristy, I really liked Lagos! An easy 8/10. I can't imagine what the summer here would look like, though...
