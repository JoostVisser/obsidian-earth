When will I go to Japan?

The two parts that'll determine my Japan trip:
- Which co-living do I pick?
- Fellow people I know in Japan.


So for now, let's:
- Make a list of funky co-living spaces I can stay at, and...
- Poke Dan Dan, Andr√© and Breno, haha.

Requirements:
- Can work form 2PM to 10PM, so need a 24/7 co-working spot or a nice spot I can stay from.

Website sources:
- coliving.com
- coliving.community


For co-working/co-living spots, here are spots I can stay for two weeks:
- **Shikoku:** Kotori co-working and hostel: https://www.kotori-japan.com/en/
    - Also has a pop-up co-living for a month: https://www.altcoliving.com/alt_popup/
      Focus on meditation and connecting with locals
    - Can work 24/7 from this place
- **Zushi**, near Tokyo: https://amigo-house.com/


For a month, I can go to:
- **Kyoto:** Taikoukyou coliving: https://achicochi.life/taikoukyo-coliving-apartment/#cta
- **Goto islands**
    - The pier: https://yugyo.work/thepiercoliving
    - Good for unplugging + local community
