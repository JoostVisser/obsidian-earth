When will I go to Japan?

The two parts that'll determine my Japan trip:
- Which co-living do I pick?
- Fellow people I know in Japan.



For co-working/co-living spots, here are spots I can stay for two weeks:

- Shikoku: Kotori co-working and hostel: https://www.kotori-japan.com/en/
    - Also has a pop-up co-living for a month: https://www.altcoliving.com/alt_popup/
      Focus on meditation and connecting with locals
    - Can probably work 24/7 from this place
- Zushi, near Tokyo: https://amigo-house.com/


For a month, I can go to:
- Kyoto: Taikoukyou coliving: https://achicochi.life/taikoukyo-coliving-apartment/#cta
- Goto islands
    - The pier: https://yugyo.work/thepiercoliving
    - Good for unplugging + local community
