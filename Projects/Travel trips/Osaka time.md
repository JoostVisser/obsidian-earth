Welcome to Osaka! Tokyo, but a lot more fun, or so I heard.

This'll be my first of two weeks of working, and unlike my other remote times, this time I'll stay in a hostel and book a separate co-living space.

And ehh, did I pick an interesting place. I was in the "poorest region" of Japan, the only place where basically uprising happens. The place I was staying at was "part art university", "part cafe", "part hostel" and "part second-hand shop". Some of it was helping the local poor people with some activities, sometimes they gave workshops, and sometimes they performed some music together. :)

They, ehh, "dug a well" in around 5 years by hand, grabbed a massive stone that they found inside the well, put it on display and everyone could polish the stone "and make art". The stone was polished indeed. What a place, haha.

Sadly, I could not hang out with the people all that much, because I had work from 14:30 to 23:00, which is really tough. My co-working space was half-an-hour transit, so by the time I was at the hostel it was almost midnight. Take another one or two hours of relaxing before going to sleep, wake up at 11:00, have some breakfast/lunch and boom, it's almost time for work again. Pretty rough. I'd much rather work from 13:00 to 21:00.

The coworking space itself was pretty cool. There was this massive corporation, Hanshin, that owns a big 30 story building and certain train lines. They decided to dedicate one floor entirely for co-working nomads and local starters. It was on the 26th floor so the view was fantastic, the utilities were great (of course you had your tabletennis table, but also a mini-golf track and a dedicated relaxing area), but just... nobody was really using it? They had the equipment, but lacked the soul, so to say. Still a pretty comfy time working though.

During some of my free time, I went to:
1. A nearby amusement park (Universal Studio Japan) with a fantastic Mario world
2. A really lovely aquarium with tanks spanning multiple floors where you spiral downwards, seeing different angles each time.
3. Nara. Cute park with lots of deer. Imagine a pretty big park with quite a bit of variety (temple grounds, small lakes with a small bridge over it, small hike), and now just add a bunch of deer walking around everywhere. The deer rice crackers were also pretty delicious. :)
4. Visited the cuisine association (read: red-light district) nearby, where you could walk around and see a lot of grandmothers. In the middle, you can see the girl sitting in seiza that you would take a "coffee" with. You start negotiating with the grandmother about the price of the "coffee" and the type of "coffee" after which you can start consuming it together with the girl, who keeps sitting silently and smiling at you. Did not manage to consume actual coffee here. :'(
5. Met up with a friend and ate some delicious okonomiyaki. Last time I didn't like it, but this time we had such a variety of flavours that I really enjoyed the concept.

All in all, while I did quite like Osaka, I also felt super tired afterwards. I was always "on" and there was never really a space for me to relax and quiet down, unlike next week's place. :D
