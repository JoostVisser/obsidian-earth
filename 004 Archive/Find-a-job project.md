In the end, I accepted a job at Eleo. The reasons for these are as follows:
1. Cool atmosphere and nice people. I really like the start-up vibe.
2. The company is doing something good for the world, namely the electrification of machines.
3. They offered me a half-a-year contract, something which helps with my New Zealand plans.

### My steps for finding a project
#### Step 1: Figure out what jobs are out there
- [ ] Create a list of available jobs, grouped by country, location and job-type

#### Step 2: Narrow down choices
- [ ] Prioritise my potential jobs in three levels:
    - 1. Super interested - Explain what intrigues me
    - 2. Interested
    - 3. Not so much interested

### Step 3: Decide on foreign job

#### Step 4: Apply for related jobs
Make sure to apply for multiple jobs so I can negotiate and shoot down offers.



### Open questions
1. Do I want to work in a foreign country?
2. Do I want to work for a big company (more salary and growth, learning specialist skills) or for a scale-up (more fun work environment, learning more generalist skills)
