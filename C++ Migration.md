Potential problems:
- Huuge cost, not a lot of rewards.

- Cross-platform development can be challenging, so probably need to use WSL --> Linux

- Very difficult hosting in Azure, a lot more expensive.
- 
- 

Language complications:
- - C++ still requires knowledge about memory management (memory leaks using shared_ptr, debugging memory, ownership, etc)
- - No support for third-party  packagemanagement
- - Still require knowledge of CMakeLists.xt
