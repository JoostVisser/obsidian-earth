Potential problems:
- Huuge cost, not a lot of rewards.
- C++ still requires knowledge about memory management (memory leaks using shared_ptr, debugging memory, ownership, etc)
- Cross-platform development can be challenging, so probably need to use WSL --> Linux
- No support for third-party management
