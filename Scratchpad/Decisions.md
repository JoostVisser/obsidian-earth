> [!NOTE] Decisiveness
> In a nutshell:
>  1. Decisions relate to your values, test them and gain insights to choose.
>  2. It's fine to make wrong decisions. Make them often and fail faster.
>  3. Indecision is also a decision, but almost always the worst decision.


Making decisions is choosing between trade-offs. Both have their positive and negative points and there is no truth in them. 

Good decisions relate closely to your [[Values]], i.e. what you care about the most. If you test the decisions with respect to those values, it can give valuable insights to make your decision. Therefore, having clarity of values helps out quite a bit when you're having trouble making these decisions.

If you can't make a decision, you go towards *indecisiveness*. Indecisiveness is less than ideal, because making no choice is also a choice and has consequences as well. You can choose to do nothing, but then it was a conscious, proactive choice. If it was a conscious choice, you at least can learn from it and own the consequences, but that doesn't happen in indecision.

There are quite a few causes of indecision:
1. Unknown that a choice is possible
2. Afraid of failure
3. Putting too much importance on the decision

Some general tips that can help out:
1. Failing is alright, it's better to choose and fail then to go for indecision. It causes experience and learning, which you can empirically use for your next decisions.
2. On a related note, decisions can be walked back from.
3. When choosing between the status quo and a new state, often it's worth it to go for the new if only for the experience gained.

It's worth practicing becoming decisive by starting with the small decisions and then slowly building up towards large decisions. You learn to quickly evaluate decisions and figure out what's actually important in making those decisions (the elements of the decision that actually matter to you).
